        “There should be restrictions on development on the coast; no buildings should be built. If a hotel is built, the hotel
        must be ready to face (a megathrust earthquake), requiring the building to be able to withstand 8.5 magnitudes,” said
        BMKG head Dwikorita Karnawati in a press conference on Tuesday (Aug 20).

        On its part, the BMKG has put in place monitoring, processing and information dissemination systems for earthquake and
        tsunami early warnings that have been increasingly fast and accurate.=

        Earthquake preparedness has drawn renewed attention in Indonesia in the wake of Japan’s megaquake alert earlier this
        month.

        After a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred on the Nankai subduction zone and hit Japan’s island of Kyushu on August 8,
        the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a megaquake advisory for the first time, indicating the quake could be a
        precursor to an even larger one that could cause significant loss of lives.

        The agency ended the alert a week later and said people were free to return to their normal lifestyles.
